# C++ Core Guidelines: Best Practices for Modern C++

This is the code repository for my book [C++ Core Guidelines: Best Practices for Modern C++](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Grimm-C-Core-Guidelines-Explained-Best-Practices-for-Modern-C/PGM2928303.html)

I put the name of the source file in the title of each source code example in the book. 


## Description

C++ expert instructor Rainer Grimm offers accessible, practical coverage of the Core Guidelines that offer the most value to students learning the C++ programming language. Offering new insights, indispensable context, and proven C++17 examples drawn from his courses and seminars, Grimm helps students get more value from the guidelines. 

Grimmâ€™s wide-ranging coverage addresses C++ programming philosophy, interfaces, functions, classes, class hierarchies, enumerations, resource management, expressions, statements, performance, concurrency, error handling, constants, immutability, templates, generic programming, C-style programming, source files, the Standard Library, and more. Each section links to the original standard online, and wherever appropriate, Grimm previews advances from C++20 and C++23. With Grimm's Help, students can use the C++ Core Guidelines to write C++ code that's more consistent, robust, and well-performing.
